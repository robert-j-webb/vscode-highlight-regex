## TODO

1. Tests. Make sure it's not too slow as well.
2. Regex to grep for regexes needs to be better
3. Decorations aren't cleared after every character.
4. Colors should be high quality.
5. Clean up repo, remove old code.

## Debugging

- `npm install` to initialize the project
- `npm run watch` to start the compiler in watch mode
- open this folder in VS Code and press `F5`
- this will open the `[Extension Development Host]` window, running the extension:
  - Open any document that contains regexes and watch what happens.
